# telegram-chatbot

A bot using OpenAI API and Telegram API

Use @BotFather in Telegram to create your bot and obtain an API key.

Put the following API keys in a .env file

1. API_TOKEN="your-openai-token-here"
2. TELEGRAM_TOKEN="your-telegram-token-here"
3. Put whitelisted users in a .whitelist file. This is to ensure that the bot does not get rate-limited.
